# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to create a survey with the focus on learning react and how to use 'state'. 


## The problem

In theory, react makes sense, breaking up the components in smaller chuncks but it took alot of trial and error. 
I initially had alot of components but had to revert back as it broke the functions on my page for some unknown reason and I had no 
time figuring out why, so I had to settle for one component. 

So if I had more time id break up the Form component alot more.
