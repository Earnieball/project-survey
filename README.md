# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to create a survey with the focus on learning react and how to use 'state'. 


## The problem

I had some issues when breaking up the components as I wrote everything in App.js to start with. But once I understood the deconstruction I managed to sort it out. 
I had some minor issues along the way but nothing worth mentioning.

Sorted the issues mostly by going back to the live-stream with Daniel.
